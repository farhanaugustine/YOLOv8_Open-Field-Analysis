# YOLOv8_CustomModel_Open-Field-Analysis


This project utilizes the YoloV8 object detection model to analyze the distance, speed, and time of objects in video frames. The code snippets provided as Jupyter Script perform various tasks to process and visualize the data extracted from the model's output.

# Code Snippets Overview

- ## **Import Libraries**: Essential libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib` are imported for data manipulation and visualization.

- ## **Average Speed & Time**: Calculates the average speed of objects and the time spent in each ROI, offering insights into object behavior.

- ## **Entries & Exits**: Smooths the coordinates and counts the number of entries and exits made per ROI, useful for understanding object interaction with specific areas.

- ## **Graph Entries/Exits**: Visualizes the number of entries and exits for each ROI and highlights the first ROI entered, aiding in the interpretation of object flow.

# Usage

This project is designed to be user-friendly and adaptable to various video analysis needs. Here are the steps to get started:

1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure you have a Python environment with the necessary libraries (`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`) installed. These libraries are fundamental for data manipulation and visualization.

2. **Data Preparation**: Place path to your `.txt` files in code block 2. Make sure the files are named appropriately to reflect the frame sequence.

3. **Code Execution**: Run the code cells in the provided order. Each cell is designed to perform a specific task, contributing to the overall analysis. You can adjust parameters like `window_size` as needed for your specific data.

4. **Result Interpretation**: The final outputs include calculated metrics (average speed, time spent, entries, and exits per ROI) and visualizations. These results provide valuable insights into object behavior and interactions within the video frames.

5. **Customization**: Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific needs. The modular design of the code snippets allows for easy adjustments and enhancements.

By following these steps, users can effectively analyze object movement in video data. This analysis can reveal patterns and behaviors that might not be immediately apparent, providing a deeper understanding of the video content. Whether you're studying traffic patterns, observing wildlife, or monitoring security footage, this project offers a robust toolset for video analysis.
