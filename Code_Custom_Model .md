1. Create Anaconda Environment 

`conda create -n yolov8 python=3.9`


2. Extract Frames from Behavior Videos

` ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "fps=1/2" -frames:v 40 output_%02d.png `


3. Create a New Folder (label: "images") and Move Extracted Frames into the "images" folder
       3.1. Create another folder and label it "labels" 


4. Install Image Annotation Tool

` pip install labelImg `


5.  Run Annotation Tool

`labelImg `

Change the Save Directory by making a new folder (call it: labels) from labelImg Interface.
Make sure that the source is selected to be YOLO and not Pascalvoc


6. Annotate your Object by creating a rectangle and labeling it. 


7. Install ultralytics

` pip install ultralytics `


8. Upgrade/Install Pytorch 

Copy code from here and install it into your environment: ` https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ `

Example: ` pip3 install --upgrade torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 `


9. Create "val" and "train" folders

10. Subdivide "val" folder by making two more folders (i.e., "images" and "labels" folders, respectively; these will be used for evaluation of model after training).

         10.1. Move some of your training images from the training folder into the "images" folder under the val directory. Move the corresponding labels from the training folder into the "labels" folder under the val directory. [delete the images and labels that you are moving from training directory to the val subfolders so that the algorithm won't see these images or labels while training]  


11. Create "data_custom.yaml" using text editor [copy the code below into "data_custom.yaml" file using text editor]


train: "Path to your train images folder"
val: "Path to your val folder"
nc: 1

names: ["Mouse"]


12. Run YOLO for training on your images

` yolo task=detect mode=train epochs=500 data=data_custom.yaml model=yolov8m.pt imgsz=640 batch=8 ` 

13. Run YOLO Custom Model on New Videos with Labeled Predictions

` yolo task=detect mode=predict model=best.pt show=True conf=0.5 save_txt=True source= path_to_.mp4 `

14. Run YOLO Custom Model on New Videos without Labels and Confidences Printed on the Video

` yolo task=detect mode=predict model=best.pt show=True conf=0.5 save_txt=True source= path_to_.mp4 hide_labels=True hide_conf=True" `
